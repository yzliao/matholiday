==========

A Matlab library for sending holiday emails to your family and friends.

The main file is matholiday.m. You need to specify your username and password at the top 
of this file. Currently, we only support Gmail. If you hope to use other mail services, 
such as Yahoo! or Outlook, please open an issue.

The CSV file uses the exported contact file from Gmail (in Outlook format).
